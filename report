## Deep features:
    * we find some images are too small, so we need resize it to 231x231 to fit the soft requirement.
    * we mainly use the python script to deal with the data, we mainly use imagemagick to deal with the image.
    * `make-overfeat-cmd.py` is to conver raw image to feature files, which store in deep/
    * `normalize-overfeat.py` is to combine these feature into a file to fit svm_multoclass format.
    * we assume the test image is under test/, we have already add python command into c++ (through system call).
    * result: 

## Future imporvement:
